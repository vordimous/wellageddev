This is a collection of bullet points for how an effective management style should be implemented.

## Team

- Your managers goal is the make the most of your time and not require most of your time.
- Your manager should trust you to manage your own time. You don’t need to clear with me in advance your time AFK or OOO.
- 1:1 are for the team and will be documented privately with you, me, and your lead. Any feedback on PAR reviews will come from this document.
- Please ask for help when you need it. Nobody works alone.

## Leaders

- Your manager doesn't need to approve or know about everything, your judgment is important on when your manager can help. If you think your manager will be surprised then they need to be updated.
- You will focus on your team's success, your manager should work with you to create and manage what success looks like. Success shouldn't be measured by vanity metrics.
- New ideas are important, we will foster and evaluate, but decide and move on.
- FOSS is the baseline example fo what can be achieved. We can’t compare ourselves to companies more than double our size. Less is more.

## Management Style

- Trust people to decide on good PTO/OOO for individual days. Only require pre-approval for longer than 3 days. Having days on the calendar 2 weeks ahead of time is preferred.
- In 1:1s, note-taking will include all important details and feedback. You will be informed as early as possible about anything that would come up in a review.
- Plan work as much ahead of time as possible, loosely implement structures like sprints and add on as needed.
- Use growth days that are flexible for you to choose. ex. take one full day or two half days.
