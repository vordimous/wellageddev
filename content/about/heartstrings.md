# Music Therapy Coop - Financial Model

## Core Model: The 1:4 Ratio

**Fundamental principle:** Admin effort is 1/4 of therapist effort per contact hour.

This ratio drives all compensation:
- Therapist base: **40-60%** of session rate (based on experience)
- Admin base: **10-15%** of session rate (based on experience)
- Overhead/Profit Pool: **25-50%** (minimum 25% at top brackets)

**Goal:** Help every member reach the top of their bracket.

| Role | Entry | Mid | Top | Ratio |
|------|-------|-----|-----|-------|
| Therapist | 40% | 50% | 60% | 4 |
| Admin | 10% | 12.5% | 15% | 1 |
| Overhead/Profit | 50% | 37.5% | 25% | — |

## Core Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Session rate (client pays) | $90/contact hour |
| Therapist base range | $36-54/contact hr (40-60%) |
| Admin base range | $9-13.50/contact hr (10-15%) |
| Contact hours per therapist/week | 15-20 hrs |
| Real work hours per therapist/week | 30-40 hrs (2:1 ratio) |
| Admin capacity | 1 admin per 4 therapists |
| Weeks per month | 4.33 (52/12) |
| Weeks per quarter | 13 |

|-----------|---|--------|-------|
| Therapist | 40% | $36.00 | Entry rate |
| Admin | 10% | $9.00 | Entry rate |
| Overhead/Profit | 50% | $45.00 | Maximum pool |
| **Total** | 100% | $90.00 | |

### At Mid Level

## 2. Revenue & Base Pay Projections

### Monthly Revenue by Team Size (at $90/hr)

| Therapists | Contact Hrs/Month | Gross Revenue/Month |
|------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 4 | 260 hrs | $23,400 |
| 5 | 325 hrs | $29,250 |
| 6 | 390 hrs | $35,100 |

*Calculation: therapists × 15 hrs/week × 4.33 weeks × $90*

### Monthly Base Pay by Experience Level (5 Therapists, 325 hrs)

| Level | Therapist Rate | Total Therapist Base | Admin Rate | Admin Base | Overhead Pool |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|------------|------------|---------------|
| Entry | $36 (40%) | $11,700 | $9 (10%) | $2,925 | $14,625 (50%) |
| Mid | $45 (50%) | $14,625 | $11.25 (12.5%) | $3,656 | $10,969 (37.5%) |
| Top | $54 (60%) | $17,550 | $13.50 (15%) | $4,388 | $7,313 (25%) |

### Quarterly Base Pay (5 Therapists, 975 hrs)

| Level | Total Therapist Base | Admin Base | Overhead Pool |
|-------|---------------------|------------|---------------|
| Entry | $35,100 | $8,775 | $43,875 |
| Mid | $43,875 | $10,969 | $32,906 |
| Top | $52,650 | $13,163 | $21,938 |

## 3. Profit Pool Allocation

The overhead/profit pool is split the same 1:4 ratio:

| Allocation | % of Profit Pool | Purpose |
|------------|------------------|---------|
| Therapist Pool | 60% | Distributed by contact hrs worked |
| Admin Pool | 15% | Distributed by contact hrs managed |
| Reserve/Holdings | 25% | Expenses, growth, rainy day |
| **Total** | 100% | |

### Why 60/15/25?

The 60/15 split maintains the 4:1 ratio (60÷15 = 4).
The 25% reserve ensures the coop builds capital.

## 5. Annual Compensation Summary

### At Mid Level (50% / 12.5% / 37.5%)

| Role | Annual Base | Annual Profit Share | Total Annual | Effective/Contact Hr |
|------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Therapist | $35,100 | $15,795 | $50,895 | $65.25/hr |

|------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Therapist | $42,120 | $10,530 | $52,650 | $67.50/hr |
| Admin | $52,650 | $13,163 | $65,813 | $16.88/managed hr |

*Note: Admin manages 4 therapists × 780 hrs/year = 3,120 managed contact hours*

---

## 6. The 1:4 Ratio Validation

### Does the math hold?

At top bracket ($90 session):
- Therapist gets: $54 base + $13.50 profit share = **$67.50/contact hr**
- Admin gets: $13.50 base + $3.38 profit share = **$16.88/managed contact hr**
- Ratio: $67.50 ÷ $16.88 = **4.0** ✓

At mid bracket ($90 session):
- Therapist gets: $45 base + $20.25 profit share = **$65.25/contact hr**
- Admin gets: $11.25 base + $5.06 profit share = **$16.31/managed contact hr**
- Ratio: $65.25 ÷ $16.31 = **4.0** ✓

**The 1:4 ratio holds at all experience levels.**

## 7. Quarterly Discount Packages

Clients can prepay for a quarter (13 sessions) at discounted rates. The discount reduces the profit pool, not base pay.

### Package Pricing

| Package | Rate/Session | Quarterly Total | Discount vs $90 | Savings to Client |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Standard | $90 | $1,170 | 0% | $0 |
| Bronze | $85 | $1,105 | 5.6% | $65 |
| Silver | $80 | $1,040 | 11.1% | $130 |
| Gold | $75 | $975 | 16.7% | $195 |

### Revenue Impact Per Package Client (13 sessions, Top Level)

| Package | Revenue | Therapist Base (60%) | Admin Base (15%) | Profit Pool (25%) |
|---------|---------|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Standard | $1,170 | $702 | $175.50 | $292.50 |
| Bronze | $1,105 | $663 | $165.75 | $276.25 |
| Silver | $1,040 | $624 | $156.00 | $260.00 |
| Gold | $975 | $585 | $146.25 | $243.75 |

*Note: Base pay percentages are protected regardless of discount tier*

### Impact on Profit Pool - Mixed Client Scenarios

**Scenario: 5 therapists at top level, 975 contact hrs/quarter**

| Client Mix | Avg Rate | Quarterly Revenue | Profit Pool (25%) | vs Standard |
|------------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 100% Standard ($90) | $90.00 | $87,750 | $21,938 | — |
| 75% Std / 25% Bronze | $88.75 | $86,531 | $21,633 | -$305 |
| 50% Std / 50% Silver | $85.00 | $82,875 | $20,719 | -$1,219 |
| 100% Gold ($75) | $75.00 | $73,125 | $18,281 | -$3,656 |

### Recommended Discount Strategy

| Guideline | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Max Gold clients | 10-15% of total |
| Max Silver clients | 20-25% of total |
| Target blended rate | $85-87/session |

---

## 8. Sensitivity Analysis

### What Happens at Different Utilization Rates?

**5 therapists at mid level, varying contact hours:**

| Avg Contact Hrs/Week | Monthly Revenue | Monthly Profit Pool | Per Therapist Profit Share |
|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| 10 hrs | $19,500 | $7,313 | $878 |
| 12 hrs | $23,400 | $8,775 | $1,053 |
| 15 hrs | $29,250 | $10,969 | $1,316 |
| 18 hrs | $35,100 | $13,163 | $1,580 |
| 20 hrs | $39,000 | $14,625 | $1,755 |

### Break-Even Analysis

At mid level, the profit pool is 37.5% of revenue. As long as revenue covers base pay, the model works.

**Minimum viable operation:**
- Base pay comes first (therapist + admin)
- At 62.5% base pay allocation, break-even is any positive revenue
- Profit pool and reserve are bonuses on top of base pay

---

## 9. Scaling: Multiple Admins

### When to Add a Second Admin

One admin can manage ~4 therapists (80 contact hrs/week).

| Therapists | Contact Hrs/Week | Admins Needed |
|------------|------------------|---------------|
| 1-4 | Up to 80 | 1 |
| 5-8 | 80-160 | 2 |
| 9-12 | 160-240 | 3 |

### Admin Pool Distribution with Multiple Admins

The 15% admin pool is divided by total managed contact hours, then each admin gets their proportional share based on therapists managed.

**Example: 8 therapists, 2 admins (4 each)**
- Total contact hrs: 1,560/quarter
- Admin pool (15% of profit): $X
- Each admin gets: $X ÷ 2 = equal share (if managing equal therapists)

---

## 10. Key Takeaways

1. **1:4 ratio is the foundation** - Admin compensation is always 1/4 of therapist compensation per contact hour

2. **Experience brackets drive base pay** - 40-60% for therapists, 10-15% for admin, with 25-50% for overhead/profit

3. **Profit pool follows the same ratio** - 60% to therapist pool, 15% to admin pool, 25% to reserve

4. **Base pay is protected** - Discounts reduce profit pool, not base pay percentages

5. **Goal is top bracket for all** - As members gain experience, they progress toward 60%/15% rates

## 11. Real-World Scenario: Year 1 Reconciliation

### Given Data

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Billed contact hours | 828 hrs |
| Average session rate | $80/hr |
| Therapist base rate | $48/hr (60% of $80 = Top bracket) |
| Therapist already paid | $39,768 |
| Bank balance after expenses | $18,318.05 |

### Applying the 1:4 Model

**At Top Bracket (60% / 15% / 25%):**

| Allocation | % | Rate/Hr | Annual Amount (828 hrs) |
|------------|---|---------|------------------------|
| Therapist Base | 60% | $48.00 | $39,744.00 |
| Admin Base | 15% | $12.00 | $9,936.00 |
| Overhead/Profit | 25% | $20.00 | $16,560.00 |
| **Total** | 100% | $80.00 | **$66,240.00** |

### Reconstructed Financials

| Line Item | Calculation | Amount |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Gross Revenue | 828 hrs × $80 | $66,240.00 |
| Therapist Base (60%) | 828 hrs × $48 | $39,744.00 |
| Admin Base (15%) | 828 hrs × $12 | $9,936.00 |
| **Overhead/Profit Pool (25%)** | 828 hrs × $20 | **$16,560.00** |

### What Actually Happened

| Line Item | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Gross Revenue | $66,240.00 |
| Therapist Paid | $39,768.00 |
| Expenses Paid | $8,153.95 |
| **Bank Balance** | **$18,318.05** |

### Reconciliation

| Item | Model Says | Actually Paid | Difference |
|------|------------|---------------|------------|
| Therapist Base | $39,744.00 | $39,768.00 | +$24 overpaid |
| Admin Base | $9,936.00 | $0.00 | $9,936 owed |
| Expenses | from profit pool | $8,153.95 | paid |
| Profit Pool | $16,560.00 | — | to distribute |

**Available for Admin + Profit:** $18,318.05

### Settlement Using 1:4 Model

**Step 1: Pay Admin Base**
- Admin base owed (15%): $9,936.00
- Remaining: $18,318.05 - $9,936.00 = **$8,382.05**

**Step 2: Distribute Profit Pool**

The $8,382.05 remaining is the profit pool (after expenses were already paid).

| Pool | % | Amount |
|------|---|--------|
| Therapist Pool | 60% | $5,029.23 |
| Admin Pool | 15% | $1,257.31 |
| Reserve | 25% | $2,095.51 |
| **Total** | 100% | **$8,382.05** |

**Step 3: Distribute by Contact Hours**

Therapist pool ($5,029.23) ÷ 828 hrs = **$6.07/hr**
Admin pool ($1,257.31) ÷ 828 managed hrs = **$1.52/hr**

| Recipient | Contact Hrs | Profit Share |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Therapist | 828 hrs | $5,029.23 |
| Admin | 828 managed | $1,257.31 |

### Final Settlement Summary

| Recipient | Base Pay | Profit Share | Total Owed Now |
|-----------|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Admin | $9,936.00 | $1,257.31 | **$11,193.31** |
| Therapist | (already paid) | $5,029.23 | **$5,029.23** |
| Reserve | — | $2,095.51 | (retained) |

**Post-distribution bank balance:** $18,318.05 - $11,193.31 - $5,029.23 = **$2,095.51** (reserve)

### Validation: Does the 1:4 Ratio Hold?

| Role | Base | Profit Share | Total | Per Contact Hr |
|------|------|--------------|-------|----------------|
| Therapist | $39,744 | $5,029 | $44,773 | $54.07/hr |
| Admin | $9,936 | $1,257 | $11,193 | $13.52/hr |

**Ratio check:** $54.07 ÷ $13.52 = **4.0** ✓

### Year 1 Total Compensation

| Role | Total Received | Effective Rate |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| Therapist | $44,797.23 | $54.10/contact hr |
| Admin | $11,193.31 | $13.52/managed hr |

*The 1:4 ratio is maintained perfectly.*

### Comparison: Old Model vs 1:4 Model

| Item | Old Model ($10/hr, 10%) | 1:4 Model (15% base) |
|------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Admin Base | $8,280 | $9,936 |
| Admin Profit | $912 | $1,257 |
| Admin Total | $9,192 | $11,193 |
| Therapist Profit | $9,126 | $5,029 |
| Reserve | $0 | $2,096 |

**Key difference:** The 1:4 model gives admin a higher base (15% vs ~12.5%), builds a reserve, and maintains the exact 4:1 ratio throughout.

## Open Questions

- [ ] What's the target admin weekly hours? (affects whether compensation is fair)
- [ ] Should admin base be per-hour-billed or fixed monthly?
- [ ] What % should go to expenses/holdings? (used 10% above)
- [ ] Are there different rates for groups vs individual sessions?
- [ ] Contract/program pricing - same $90/hr or volume discount?
